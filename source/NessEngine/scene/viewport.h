/**
* A viewport is a special region on which we can render scenes.
* you can render without a viewport. when you render a scene without viewport it will just render on the
* entire screen without any special settings. however, a viewport let you define the following settings:
* 1. viewport source size, i.e. the size in pixels of the region you can render on (this also affect culling)
* 2. viewport dest size, i.e. the size in pixels of the viewport as it will be rendered on screen. if your source size
*		is 100x100 and the dest size is 200x200, it means every pixel on this viewport will be doubled.
* 3. viewport dest position, i.e. where to render the viewport.
* 4. viewport source position, i.e. extra offset for all renderings.
* 5. add a black and white mask texture that acts as the alpha channels of the viewport. you can use it to create a
*		viewport in any shape and size.
* 6. basic transformations: color, scale, rotation, flip etc..
*
* example of cases where you need a viewport:
*	1. you want to render a scene inside a special shape based on a mask. for example a mini-map at the corner of the screen with a circular shape.
*	2. when you want to flip or rotate the entire screen, zoom in and out, do color tilt on everything, etc..
*	3. limit your render region or create split-screen effect. for example to create split-screen for two players: create two viewports; one for the
*		left side and one for the right side of the screen. each viewport will be rendered with a different camera based on the player position.
*	4. create post-render effects that are based on texture manipulation (for example add blurry effect etc)
*
* its important to understand that a viewport is meant to be something static, i.e. a region on screen to render on. don't try to use a viewport like a sprite.
* if you want to create effects like portals that show a different scene inside or windows you can look outside, don't use a viewport, use a Canvas instead. you can 
* a Canvas can do everything a Viewport does, but its API is more fitting for a renderable sprite entity.
*
* note1: the viewport is implemented with the Canvas entity. its very easy to implement your own viewport.
* note2: if you only use the viewport to zoom-in or zoom-out, please consider using renderer->set_renderer_size() instead.
