'''Ness-Engine''' is an [[open source]] 2D rendering engine written in [[C++|C++]] under the [[zlib License|zlib]] license.<ref name="ness-engine.com">http://www.ness-engine.com/</ref> It uses [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL2.0]] for rendering and event handling.

== Design ==
The engine is primarily designed for an [[object-oriented]] approach to scene rendering; Every renderable object in the engine is either an entity or a scene node arranged in a [[Scene graph]] structure, transformations and other rendering effects are inherited from parent nodes to their sons.

== Languages ==
The engine is written in [[C++]] and currently have no bindings to other languages.

== Features ==

Ness-Engine provides the following graphic functions:
* [[Sprite (computer graphics) | Sprites]]:
** Support scaling, rotation, flipping, alpha blending, mod and additive blending, color tinting and opacity.
** Render on sprites, masking using external texture.
** Sprite sheet animation.
** Extendable sprite class.
* Rendering utilities:

** Built-in background scrolling / [[Parallax scrolling | Parallax scrolling]].
** Rendering targets that allows to render an entire scene or node onto a texture or sprite.
** Static nodes to render massive amount of static entities with low cost.
* Text:
